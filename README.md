<h1 align="center">hyper-adapter-queue</h1>
<p align="center">The hyper queue service allows the hyper client to create queues,
setting up a webhook endpoint to be invoked everytime a job is posted to the queue.
This service can provide worker push queues to serverless applications, without having
to manage state. This adapter uses an in-memory queue and is designed to work with
local hyper services or services with small workloads.</p>
